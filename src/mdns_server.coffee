# Pow's `mDnsServer` is designed to respond to mDNS `A` queries with
# `127.0.0.1` for all subdomains of the specified top-level domain.
# We can't use mDNSResponder as it will not register addition `A`
# records. Stricly, the mDNS draft recommends 

# XXX: We SHOULD listen on each interface seperately so we can
# respond with the appropriate IP to the multicast address over
# that interface. For now, it's hacked a little and will look up
# the address we'd use to contact the sender via `route` and
# `ifconfig`.
